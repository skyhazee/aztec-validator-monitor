## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your own bot up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   A server/VPS or a computer that can run 24/7
-   A Telegram account

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal on your server and clone this repository.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/skyhazee/aztec-validator-monitor.git](https://github.com/skyhazee/aztec-validator-monitor.git)
cd aztec-validator-monitor
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional, but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment is a best practice to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# Create the environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file and fill it with the library list below.

**`requirements.txt` file:**
```txt
python-telegram-bot
python-dotenv
cloudscraper
apscheduler
pytz
```

Then, install everything with a single command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

The bot needs your API token and Telegram ID to function. Create a `.env` file by copying the example.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file.

```ini
# Replace with the bot token you received from @BotFather on Telegram
BOT_TOKEN="123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"

# Replace with your Telegram User ID.
# To get it, send the /start command to @userinfobot
TELEGRAM_ID="123456789"
```

### Step 5: Run the Bot

Once all configurations are complete, run the bot with the following command.

```bash
python bot.py
```

If there are no errors, your bot is now active and ready to use! You can leave this terminal running or use a tool like `screen` or `tmux` to keep the bot running after you close your SSH session.

## ü§ñ How to Use the Bot

Interact with the bot using the following commands in your Telegram chat with it.

-   `/start`
    Displays a welcome message and a summary of the bot's functions.

-   `/add <validator_address>`
    Adds a validator address to the monitoring list. The bot will start sending notifications for this address.
    *Example:* `/add 0x123abc...`

-   `/remove <validator_address>`
    Removes a validator address from the monitoring list.
    *Example:* `/remove 0x123abc...`

-   `/list`
    Shows all validator addresses you are currently monitoring.

-   `/check`
    Requests a full status report for all validators on your monitoring list. The bot will send one detailed message for each validator.
